Just Like the name, in bubble sorting the biggest value in an array bubbles out to the top(End of array).
It is a simple sorting algo where we compares the value of 1st index to all the indexes sequentially.
If we found for say 4th index of an array to be less than 1st.If 1st > 4th index 
Swaps 4th with 1st.
Now runs comparisons from 2nd index(i) with all the indexes(j).
Small values keeps getting Pushed back.
Greater values keeps getting promoted Forward.
